# Archetype for AppPresser #

<img align="right" src="./assets/dist/img/touch-icon.png" title="Archetype WordPress Theme" alt="Archetype WordPress Theme" /> A Bootstrap-powered child theme boilerplate for AppPresser. You won't want to run this as-is, but it serves as a great starting point when you like these tools. Consider pairing it with my [Bootstrap shortcodes plugin](https://github.com/logoscreative/bs-wp-shortcodes) for use by more savvy clients.

Includes:

1. [Bootstrap 3.3.1](http://getbootstrap.com/)
1. [Font Awesome 4.2.0](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)

## Constants ##

### ARCHETYPE_ENQUEUE ###

By default, Archetype pulls Bootstrap and Font Awesome files from [Bootstrap CDN](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/). To use local resources, you'll use [Bower](http://bower.io/). Once it's installed (`npm install -g bower`), run `bower install` in Archetype's root directory to automatically install the dependencies. Then, place `define( 'ARCHETYPE_ENQUEUE', 'bower' );` in your `wp-config.php` file to enqueue those files instead.

When you use the Bower option, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) lints and compiles LESS and JS files on your behalf. Once you've got the [necessary items](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) installed, you can start by editing `assets/dev/js/main.js` and `assets/dev/less/main.less`, then run `grunt` in the child theme's directory. Run `grunt watch` to automatically run everything when you save one of the watched files.

## Troubleshooting ##

Please feel free to file an issue here if you find a bug, and I'll do my best to fix it if it betters the theme for everyone. I'll gladly review pull requests for new features, and will consider merging itâ€”again if it betters the theme for everyone.

**For the most part, this will be unsupported.** I'll do what I can, but don't expect much.
